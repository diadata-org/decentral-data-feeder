## Randomness
Our randomness product currently serves random integers on [Somnia testnet](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/).\
Randomness can be requested using the following requestor contract on Somnia:\
[0xedF6b67Efc4e34DbEe3B3cD7AAD0b577F08227A2](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0xedF6b67Efc4e34DbEe3B3cD7AAD0b577F08227A2)

A feeder on diadata cluster listens to events generated by the previous requestor contract. Once such an event is recorded, randomness with the corresponding parameters is requested from Randamu API and stored in the following contract:
[0xd9cdbE89011F03c425B20bca46C337C68Ad49396](https://testnet-explorer.diadata.org/address/0xd9cdbE89011F03c425B20bca46C337C68Ad49396)

The diadata bridge from Lasernet to Somnia testnet finally bridges the response back to the `fulfillRandomInt` function in the above requestor contract on Somnia testnet. This way, randomness can be queried on Somnia using the provided `requestID`.
